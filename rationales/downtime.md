### Carlos Saura

I discovered this director recently. Timeless and completely underrated movies. It's still early to make specific recommendations.

### Daft Punk

### Wong Kar-wai

I discovered this director recently. I only watched his first two movies (1988) [As tears go by](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096461/) and (1990) [Days of being wild](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0101258) so it's still early to make recommendations.

### Park Chan-wook

Korean Tarantino.

### Ghoulie

Daft Punk's imaginary last concert.

### Mr. Bungle

Classical percussion cover. The [baritone horn/tuba](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rC2O6VUGuKs) and [piano](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8LX9PADTrE) covers are also amazing. This song was written by Trey Spruance, not by Mike Patton.

Mr. Bungle's [concert](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wVGbhunXx4) was - easily - the best one I ever assisted.

### Roisin Murphy

[Here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYQ6wAmHo-w) more. [Real artists](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9u0-3H4I4o) are [humble](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq1mn7nllTQ). 

### Maelle

### Gabriel Gárcia Márquez

[Just realized](https://www.thefreelibrary.com/THE+ETERNAL+WAIT+FOR+%22GODOT%22+IN+GARCIA+MARQUEZ%27S+%22NO+ONE+WRITES+TO...-a0626843754) that "No one writes to the colonel" (1961) may be a remake of "Waiting for Godot" (1952) by Samuel Beckett.
