	<p class="subtitle">Sponsoring. How does it work?</p>
</header>

<main>
	<section>
		<ul>
			<li>Only the main page is open for sponsors - for now.<br>Non-negotiable: only one sponsor per page.</li>
			<li><p>Actual price: 100€ quarterly.</p>
			If the spot is taken, you may propose a price «raise» to get it next quarter. A couple of weeks before the quarter’s end, the incubent will be informed of the highest raise - if any. If he doesn’t «call» the price, his sponsoring will be terminated. The actual price will be updated here.</li>
			<li>The sponsor will get one colored text link (adblock resistant - no JS) on the top of the main page and on the <a href="https://slowernews.substack.com/">quarterly newsletter</a>. 140 UTF characters allowed. Quarterly - as a call for attention - you may change the link color.</li>
			<li>Past traffic - that doesn’t use adblock - is <a href="https://slowernews.goatcounter.com">showed here</a>. Most traffic is direct. Most people found Slower News on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25535456">Hacker News</a>.</li>
			<li>Paid by Paypal or Crypto. Don’t expect receipts. Like Slower News itself, the process is analogic and amateur. Hopefully <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=galfarragem">trustable</a>.</li>
			<li>Even if something is less palatable... <a href="mailto:archimodelsblog@gmail.com">say hi, maybe we can work it out</a>. Above all, I want everybody happy. Sponsors and readers.</li>

	<h3>WTF is Slower News?</h3>
	<p>These are, somehow, curated news extracting relevant trends and some edge cases for borderline nerds, that don’t want to miss out, nor spend a shit-ton of time filtering trivia.</p>

	<h3>Why?</h3>
	<p>I wanted to read something like this - an information flood is drowning our times - but I couldn’t find it elsewhere. So, as most projects, it started while «scratching my own itch» and before becoming a website it lived as a markdown file.</p>
	<p>Making sense of chaos is a sisyphean task but I see it as a <a href="http://www.structuredprocrastination.com/">way of using my procrastination positively</a>.</p>

	<h3>How do you curate articles?</h3>
	<p>I cherry-pick articles that dissect trends or unveil lesser known trends and interesting edge cases, and are relevant, at least, for some months. It’s certainly affected by my biases (<a href="https://github.com/slowernews/slowernews#footnote1">I’m aware of these</a>) and most articles were on Hacker News. The articles’ listing order is not random.</p>

	<h3>How often is Slower News updated?</h3>
	<p>Only when relevant. Visit every month and «you’re good to go». New articles are easy to spot but there is <a href="https://www.slowernews.com/rss.xml">RSS</a> and a <a href="https://slowernews.substack.com/welcome">newsletter</a> also.

	<h3 id="contribute">Can I contribute?</h3>
	<p>Open an issue or pull request <a href="https://github.com/slowernews/slowernews">the repository</a> with relevant links, corrections or suggestions. I’m curating only a few pages (this, <a href="https://www.slowernews.com/s/portugal">one about Portugal</a> and <a href="https://www.slowernews.com/s/timeless">Timeless</a>) but <a href="https://github.com/slowernews/slowernews#so-what-pages-can-i-create">I accept pull requests creating/curating more</a> - if you can handle the burden of using raw HTML. For now, this is my filter to accept them.</p> 

	<h3>Colophon</h3>
	<p>Hand coded - fully functional without JS - and statically hosted at Netlify via a Github repository. Tufte CSS (adapted) with native darkmode. No images, no tracking (GDPR friendly analytics with <a href="https://slowernews.goatcounter.com">Goatcounter</a>) and <a href="https://gtmetrix.com/reports/www.slowernews.com/iRNCHojs/">no bloat</a>. Ok, it uses non-standard fonts but web design is mostly typography.</p>
